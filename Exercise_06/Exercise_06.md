### <a name="setup-dev-env"></a> Setup the Development Environment
For the exercises where we develop SAPUI5 and Java applications, we will work with the SAP WebIDE in SAP Cloud Platform. To save time, we prepared a project for you so that we can focus on the ML Foundation parts. This project needs to be imported into your SAP Web IDE workspace. You will extend the applications included in the project to test the SAP Leonardo ML services. 

In this chapter, you will initialize the SAP Web IDE and import the given project. It will be used later in the corresponding exercises.

Required resources for this step:

* [MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise.zip](files/MLFSAPUI5_Project_Exercise.zip)
* [MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Solution.zip](files/MLFSAPUI5_Project_Solution.zip)

1. Open Firefox as Chrome will use SSO for SAP Employees. Login to SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit via <http://cloudplatform.sap.com>. Login with your given e-Mail 
**ml-train+XX@sap.com**, where **XX** must be replaced by your group number, and the password provided by the trainer.

### <a name="image-classification"></a> Use SAP Leonardo ML Image Classification with SAPUI5
In this exercise you will learn how to quickly integrate the Image and Product Image Classification SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Functional Services published from the SAP API Business Hub sandbox in a SAPUI5 application. These will be the steps you will go through:

* Import a SAPUI5 application calling a REST service (see prerequisites)
* Create a destination in SCP Cockpit to your ML Service endpoint in API Business Hub
* Use the API Key for the image and product image classification from SAP API Business Hub
* Adjust your prepared SAPUI5 application
* Run the SAPUI5 application and test your ML Services.

1.	Open a new tab in your Firefox web browser and go to SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit <http://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit>. Login in case you are not already logged in by using the given credentials and not SSO  
	![](images/15.png)

### <a name="adjust-app"></a> Adjust the prepared SAPUI5 application to access your ML foundation services
For the exercises where we develop SAPUI5 and Java applications, we will work with the SAP WebIDE in SAP Cloud Platform. To save time, we prepared a project for you so that we can focus on the ML Foundation parts. This project needs to be imported into your SAP Web IDE workspace. You will extend the applications included in the project to test the SAP Leonardo ML services. 

1.	Open your SAP Web IDE Full-Stack edition  
	![](images/22.png)
1.	Open the *neo-app.json* file located under **MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise -> neo-app.json**   
	![](images/23.png)
1. Add a new route to the new destination named **sapui5ml-api**, we previously created in the SAP CP cockpit. You can copy the following code into the file (pay attention to the first comma which separates this from the previous resources)

	```json
	,
	    {
	    	"path": "/ml",
	    	"target": {
	    		"type": "destination",
	    		"name": "sapui5ml-api"
	    	},
	    	"description": "ML API description"
	    }
	```

1.	Scroll to the end of the *neo-app.json* file and add the String **"APIKey",** (pay attention to include the comma) to the **headerWhiteList** section and then save the file. This is how the file should look after these operations  
	![](images/24.png)
1.	Open the *settings.json* file located under **MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise -> webapp -> model** folder
	![](images/25.png)
1. Before we proceed with editing the *settings.json*, we need to get the **API Key** for the ML services from the API Business Hub, explained in the next steps
1.	Go to <https://api.sap.com> and click on **Business Services**
	![](images/26.png)
1.	Then just click on **SAP Leonardo Machine Learning - Functional Services**
	![](images/27.png)
1.	Click on **Artifacts**, then scroll through the list and click on the **Image Classifier Service**
	![](images/28.png)
1. Login in case you are not already logged in
1. When using any of the APIs outside of the SAP API Business Hub, an **application key** will be needed in every request header of your API calls. To get your API key click on the button in the top right corner of the page
	![](images/29.png)
1. Here you see your key. Choose the **Copy API Key** button to copy it to your clipboard
	![](images/30.png)
1. Now go back to your SAP Web IDE in SAP Cloud Platform, where the *settings.json* is still open.
For the two urls "Image Classification" and "Product Image Classification" replace the 
**<<<< COPY YOUR API KEY >>>>**  with the API key you copied in the clipboard and save the file
	![](images/31.png)
1.	Click on the **Run** icon on the toolbar to execute the application   
	![](images/32.png)
1. An application with two tiles comes up. Select the tile with the title **Image Classification**
	![](images/33.png)
1. Extract the 4 images contained in the zip file you have downloaded already as explained in the prerequisites ([test_images.zip](test_images.zip))
	![](images/34.png)
1. Either drag & drop the selected image onto the icon or press the icon to open a file select dialog.
Choose one by one *tennis_ball.jpg*, *keyboard.jpg*, *laptop.png* and *iPhoneX.jpg* as test images and analyze the results
	![](images/35.png)
1. The application charts the 5 most probable classifications for the image. To see the actual response from the server you can press the "View JSON" Button 
	![](images/36.png)
1. This concludes the exercise.


## Summary
This concludes the exercise. You are now able to:

* Use the SAP Web IDE to import a SAPUI5 application
* Create a destination that points to your ML service API endpoint in SAP API Business Hub
* Adjust a prepared project using a configured destination calling REST services from ML foundation
 
 Please proceed with next exercise.
